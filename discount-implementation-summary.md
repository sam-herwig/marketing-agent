# Discount Code Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive discount code system for the marketing automation platform with full Stripe integration and local tracking capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models (`app/models/discount.py`)
- **Discount**: Main discount record with Stripe references
- **DiscountUsage**: Tracks usage history and amounts
- **DiscountRestriction**: Flexible restriction system for eligibility

### 2. Service Layer (`app/services/discount_service.py`)
- Create discounts with automatic Stripe integration
- Validate discounts against business rules and restrictions
- Track usage and update statistics
- Generate analytics reports

### 3. Stripe Integration (`app/services/stripe_service.py`)
Enhanced with discount-specific methods:
- `create_coupon()` - Create Stripe coupons
- `create_promotion_code()` - Generate user-friendly codes
- `validate_promotion_code()` - Real-time validation
- `create_subscription_with_discount()` - Apply during checkout
- `apply_discount_to_subscription()` - Apply to existing subscriptions

### 4. API Endpoints (`app/api/discounts.py`)
- `POST /api/discounts` - Create discount (admin only)
- `GET /api/discounts` - List all discounts (admin only)
- `POST /api/discounts/validate` - Validate code for user
- `POST /api/discounts/apply` - Apply to subscription
- `GET /api/discounts/analytics` - Usage analytics
- `DELETE /api/discounts/{id}` - Expire discount

### 5. Integration Points
- Modified subscription creation to accept `discount_code`
- Added webhook handlers for discount events
- Updated model imports for database migrations
