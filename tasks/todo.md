## Review

### Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented the split prompt functionality for image generation:

1. **Backend Changes:**
   - Enhanced `ImageGenerationService` with new methods:
     - `split_prompt()`: Intelligently splits short text into background and text prompts
     - `combine_prompts()`: Combines background and text prompts with proper formatting
     - `generate_image_with_split_prompts()`: New method for split prompt generation
   - Updated API endpoints to accept split prompts while maintaining backward compatibility
   - Added automatic text styling: "Bold white sans-serif font, centered" is automatically appended

2. **Frontend Changes:**
   - Added toggle for "Use split prompts" mode
   - Created separate input fields for background and text prompts
   - Updated image generation logic to handle both single and split prompts
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing single prompt functionality

3. **Key Features:**
   - Smart background generation based on keywords (summer, winter, sale, etc.)
   - Automatic text styling enforcement
   - Clean UI with helpful placeholders
   - Error handling and validation

The implementation is simple and focused, avoiding unnecessary complexity while providing the requested functionality.

### Discount System Implementation Summary

The discount system has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. **Database Models (discount.py)**:
   - `Discount`: Main discount entity with code, type, amount/percentage, duration, and usage limits
   - `DiscountUsage`: Tracks discount usage per customer/subscription
   - `DiscountRestriction`: Flexible restriction system for targeting specific customers
   - Enums for discount types, durations, statuses, and restriction types

2. **Service Layer (discount_service.py)**:
   - `create_discount()`: Creates discounts with optional Stripe integration
   - `validate_discount()`: Comprehensive validation including restrictions
   - `apply_discount()`: Records discount usage and updates counters
   - `get_discount_analytics()`: Provides usage statistics and insights
   - `expire_discount()`: Manual discount expiration

3. **API Endpoints (discounts.py)**:
   - POST `/discounts/` - Create new discount (admin only)
   - GET `/discounts/` - List all discounts (admin only)
   - POST `/discounts/validate` - Validate discount code
   - POST `/discounts/apply` - Apply discount to subscription
   - GET `/discounts/analytics` - Get usage analytics (admin only)
   - DELETE `/discounts/{id}` - Expire discount (admin only)

4. **Stripe Integration**:
   - Automatic coupon creation in Stripe
   - Promotion code support for user-friendly codes
   - Webhook handlers for discount events
   - Methods: `create_coupon()`, `create_promotion_code()`, `apply_discount_to_subscription()`, `validate_promotion_code()`

5. **Key Features**:
   - Multiple discount types: percentage and fixed amount
   - Flexible duration: once, repeating, or forever
   - Usage limits and expiration dates
   - Advanced restrictions: first-time only, minimum amount, specific tiers, email domains
   - Real-time validation against both local and Stripe data
   - Comprehensive analytics and tracking

The implementation follows all existing codebase patterns and integrates seamlessly with the payment infrastructure.
