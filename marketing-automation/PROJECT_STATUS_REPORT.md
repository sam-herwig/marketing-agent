## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage and rate limiting
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure storage
- **APIs**: RESTful design with proper error handling
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler with persistent job storage
- **Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with request tracking
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health checks

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **API Client**: Axios with authentication interceptor
- **Forms**: Controlled components with validation
- **Routing**: App Router with protected routes

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for all services
- **Services**: PostgreSQL, Redis, n8n, Backend API, Frontend
- **Environment**: Configurable via .env files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. **OpenAI API Key**
- Current API keys showing authentication errors
- System gracefully falls back to placeholder images
- Need valid OpenAI API key for actual image generation

### 2. **Meta App Configuration**
- Instagram integration requires Meta App setup
- Need to configure OAuth redirect URIs
- Requires Instagram Business Account

### 3. **Stripe Configuration**
- Requires Stripe account and API keys
- Webhook endpoint needs to be configured in Stripe dashboard
- Test mode should be used for development

### 4. **CMS Integration**
- Not yet implemented (was in TODO list)
- Can be added as future enhancement

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env file:
   META_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id
   META_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret
   STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   OPENAI_API_KEY=valid_openai_api_key
   ```

2. **Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   # Run to ensure all tables are created
   docker-compose exec backend python -c "from app.models.database import Base, engine; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)"
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

### Testing Checklist:

1. [ ] User registration and login flow
2. [ ] Campaign creation with image generation
3. [ ] Instagram account connection (requires Meta app)
4. [ ] Stripe subscription flow (requires Stripe keys)
5. [ ] Campaign scheduling and execution
6. [ ] Monitoring dashboard functionality
7. [ ] n8n workflow execution

### Deployment Considerations:

1. **Security**
   - Update JWT_SECRET to strong random value
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Performance**
   - Add database indexes for frequent queries
   - Configure Redis persistence
   - Set up CDN for static assets
   - Implement caching strategies

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up Sentry for error tracking
   - Configure Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
   - Implement log aggregation (ELK stack)
   - Set up uptime monitoring

4. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Database backup strategy
   - Redis persistence configuration
   - Disaster recovery plan
